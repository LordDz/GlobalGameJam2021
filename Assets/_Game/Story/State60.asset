  storyText: "From screens showing the rear view, you watch the great luxury cruiser
    plummet into the blazing star.  Turning back to the front, you watch the stars
    ahead.  Once you are far enough away from the sun, the computer will take the
    ship into hyperspace and speed you back to G15-275 within a day.\r\nWith a sign
    you think fondly of the dreary little planetoid.  You have had more than enough
    adventure in your life already.  A quiet life on a backwater planetoid, that\u2019s
    what you need!\r\nYou peace is disturbed by a warning tone, and a large vessel
    suddenly looms before you.  A communications screen springs to life, and you
    see there the concerned face of a beautiful woman, with luscious red lips, large
    bright green eyes and waves of chestnut hair adorned with jade flowers.  Her
    skin is also green, but she is none the less very easy on the eye.\r\n\u201CAh,
    a human male!\u201D she exclaims with obvious delight.\r\n\u201CWhy, yes.  Yes
    I am!\u201D you say, pleased in turn.\r\n\u201CYou must help us!  My name is
    Bigones.  I represent queen Hotbutt of the planet Teeheehee.  We have been invaded
    by an army of spiders!  Our race breeds asexually and is all female!  Yet we
    have heard that human males can kill spiders!  Will you come and help us?\u201D\r\nHer
    beautiful lips tremble, and tears spill from her eyes at the thought of the horrible
    spiders.  \u201CUm,\u201D you say.  \u201CHow big are these spiders?\u201D\r\n\u201CSome
    are reputed to be as much as 2 cm in size!\u201D\r\n\u201CAre they poisonous?\u201D\r\n\u201CNo,
    but they are ugly and disgusting and creepy!\u201D\r\nA planet full of beautiful
    women needing someone to rescue them from an army of small, non-poisonous spiders? 
    Hmm.  You feel the need for adventure growing once more in your pants \u2013
    I mean, in your heart.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\n1. to start again"
