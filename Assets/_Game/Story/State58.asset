  storyText: "You push open the doors and find yourself at the bottom of a wide,
    carpeted stairway.  The single flight leads you up onto the floor of a large
    dome that sits on the top of the ship like a bubble.  It is filled with deck
    chairs allowing passengers a spectacular 360-degree view of the surrounding space.\r\nThe
    view is somewhat ruined by the massive hot-burning star directly ahead, and you
    quickly turn your attention to the two arguing men.  They are dressed as ships
    stewards, in short maroon jackets and black pants with little black hats bearing
    a maroon and gold band.  They seem oblivious to the danger, so you hurry over
    to warn them.\r\n\u201CGentlemen!\u201D you say, interrupting them.  \u201CThe
    ship is going to crash into that!  We have to get out!\u201D\r\nThe two stewards
    look at you impatiently, not even following the direction of your urgent point. 
    \u201CYes, yes!\u201D says one.  \u201CWe know!  That\u2019s why we have to get
    this right before we can go!  Now stop bothering us!\u201D\r\nThey get back to
    their argument, which seems to be about the correct positioning for the deckchairs
    in the observation dome. Astounded that they would bother with such a thing,
    you interrupt them again. \u201CAll these chairs will be burnt up when the ship
    falls into the sun!  It doesn\u2019t matter what position they are in!\u201D\r\nThe
    two of them look at you coldly.  \u201CDo we tell you how to do your job?\u201D
    one asks you.\r\n\u201CNo, but-\u201C\r\n\u201CThen leave us to do ours!\u201D
    thunders the other.\r\nThey turn away from you and start tugging at a deckchair,
    fighting over its position.  Shaking your head, you leave them to their dispute
    and hurry back out into the main corridor.\r\n\r\n1 to continue\r\n"
