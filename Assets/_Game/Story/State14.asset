  storyText: "You take out the ID and show it to the soldier.  He snatches it, quite
    unnecessarily, and stares at it.  \u201CThis doesn\u2019t look like you!\u201D\r\n\u201CI
    know,\u201D you say shaking your head in disgust.  \u201CI had the surgery over
    a month ago, but those incompetents in personnel still haven\u2019t updated my
    card!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou went from this,\u201D the soldier holds up the photo
    on the card,\u201D to that?\u201D he points at your own face.\r\nHe seems sceptical. 
    \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D you ask, somewhat offended.\r\n\u201CThat\u2019s
    like trading in a sports car for a skateboard!\u201D the soldier says.  \u201CAre
    you going to sue the surgeon for malpractice?\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m not ugly!\u201D
    you protest.\r\n\u201CGet yourself a mirror, then a lawyer,\u201D the soldier
    quips.  The others laugh \r\n\u201CMy mother always told me I was handsome!\u201D
    you insist.\r\n\u201CThat was nice of her,\u201D says another soldier  \r\nThey
    make fun of you for a while longer, making many hurtful comments (reduce your
    STAMINA by 1), then let you go.  Before they continue onwards, one of the soldiers
    says: \u201CBy the way, the ship is about to plunge into the local sun.  Best
    find a way out of here.\u201D\r\n\u201CCan I come with you?\u201D you ask.\r\n\u201CNot
    with a face like that,\u201D one says, causing the others to laugh.  \r\nThey
    move off, and you hurry in the opposite direction.  You soon reach the bridge
    and jump into the captain\u2019s chair.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m back!\u201D you declare. 
    \u201CNow what do I do?\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease insert your ID card,\u201D says
    the computer.\r\nThe cushioned armrest suddenly opens into a computer panel,
    including a card-sized slot.\r\n\r\n1. If you have your own ID and what to insert
    it\r\n2. If you want to use Gary Fishbone\u2019s ID\n"
