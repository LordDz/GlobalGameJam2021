  storyText: "You shout your command code at it, then say: \u201CLower the internal
    temperature of the ship now!  As cold as possible!\u201D\r\n\u201CYes captain,\u201D
    the computer replies.  The next moment cold air begins to blow through a vent
    nearby.  As seconds pass, it grows colder and colder, and you bask in icy relief
    for a moment.  But you have won only a temporary reprieve, and hurry onwards.\r\nThe
    corridor leads you to a loading bay, rows of large crates lying in neat rows. 
    Of greater interest to you is the small ship standing nearby.  Of equal interest,
    although much less welcome is the robotic guard dog sitting in front of the boarding
    ramp. It has a large tube-like head that is clearly a rocket launcher.\r\n\r\n1.
    If you have a blaster you can shoot the dog-bot\n2. If you want to try and sneak
    around behind it and climb aboard the ship\n"
