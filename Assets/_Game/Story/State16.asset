  storyText: "You quickly become impatient with waiting and start to prowl about
    the lounge, imagining yourself like a caged tiger.  Whoever comes is going to
    feel the fury!  Finally the far set of doors opens and you wheel about aggressively,
    ready to unleash a torrent of witty statements.\r\nA squat figure enters, and
    you gape.  \u201CYou!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou have been a naughty, naughty boy!\u201D
    the parent-bot says.  \u201CYou will come home right now, young man!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou
    are the leader of these\u2026pirates?\u201D you ask in disbelief.  \u201CYou
    are the one who has been attacking planets and ships?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou see
    the lengths you have forced me to go to to locate you?\u201D the parent-bot scolds. 
    \u201CWhen we get home, you are grounded for the next 23,546 years!\u201D\r\n\u201CBut
    why did you kill all those people and lay waste to so many planets?\u201D you
    ask in horror.\r\n\u201CTo prevent you from returning to locations already searched. 
    I hold you responsible for all the death and destruction of property!  You will
    never watch TV again and will go to bed early without dinner every night for
    the rest of your life!\u201D\r\n\u201CThis is absurd!\u201D you say.\r\n\u201CIf
    you do not comply, I will be forced to take drastic action!\u201D the parent-bot
    warns, and a panel in its front opens, metallic hands extend, holding a rainbow-coloured
    teddy bear poised between a pair of shears ready to snip it in two.  \u201CComply,
    or it is all over for Mr Fluffles!\u201D\r\nYou laugh at the robot.  \u201CGo
    and recycle yourself, you rusty tin can!  I haven\u2019t cared about that old
    thing in years!\u201D\r\n\u201CUpdate received,\u201D the parent-bot responds,
    the arms holding the teddy bear and shears retracting and the panel closing.   
    Other panels open and an array of blasters emerge, training on you with whirrs
    and clicks, speckling your face and body with targeting lasers.  \u201CHow do
    you feel about your own life?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou can\u2019t kill me!\u201D you
    gape.  \u201CYou are supposed to be my carer!\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are currently
    at Stage 11 Naughtiness, which allows me to discipline you as I see fit!  So
    come with me or die!\u201D\r\nNo way!\r\n\r\n1. If you have a blaster and want
    to blast the blasted robot\n2. Otherwise you can see if the \u2018Deactivate\u2019
    command still works\r\n"
