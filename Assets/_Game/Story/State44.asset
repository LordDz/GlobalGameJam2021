  storyText: "Taking out the programming manual, you select the relevant chapter
    and enlighten yourself with the words that appear.  With a new understanding
    you press buttons, turn dials, flick switches, pull levels and spin the crank. 
    This resets the parent-bot to \u2018spoiling\u2019.\r\nYou replace the panel
    and reactivate the unit.  It gives itself a shake, then turns to you.  \u201COh,
    dear!  You look terrible!  What can I do for you?\u201D  Six arms extend from
    holes in the sides of the unit, holding a handkerchief, a lollypop, a warm coat,
    a storybook, a bottle of milk, and Mr Fluffles.\r\n\u201CWe need to escape from
    here right now,\u201D you say.  \u201CThis ship is about to plunge into the sun!\u201D\r\n\u201COh,
    dear!  A ship this size will not be able to escape the gravity well with only
    its reverse thrusters!  I must find you another ship!\u201D  The comforts disappear,
    and the robot trundles back towards the door where it first came.\r\nYou follow
    after it, and it opens the door, but goes no further.  Turning to you, it says:
    \u201CFollow this corridor to the loading bay.  There you will find a vessel. 
    I have programmed it to take you to safety.  You need only give the command \u2018go
    mo\u2019 to activate the autopilot.  I will stay here.  Go on without me.  I
    will only slow you down.  I have lived a full life.\u201D\r\n\u201COk,\u201D
    you shrug, and run down the corridor as quickly as you can.\r\n\r\n1 to continue\r\n"
