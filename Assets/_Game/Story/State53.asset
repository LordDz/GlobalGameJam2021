  storyText: 'Your aim is poor and your blast goes awry.  You keep firing, but the
    dog-bot fires back, its head engulfed in a cloud of smoke and flame as it fires
    a rocket at you.  You duck back behind the barrels, a foolish and futile move
    as the rocket ignites the barrels of fuel and a great explosion sends you to
    a quick fiery death, sparing you the slow fiery death of falling into the sun.

    

    YOUR
    ADVENTURE ENDS HERE
