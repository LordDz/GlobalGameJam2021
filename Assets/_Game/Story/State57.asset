  storyText: "You continue on your way and finally the corridor ends at a pair of
    doors bearing the designation: \u201CBridge.\u201D\r\nThe doors open at your
    approach and you enter into the correctly labelled room.  As you step inside,
    the first thing you notice is the bright light shining from the front of the
    room where the large viewscreen fills the wall.  Light and heat from the image
    of the sun directly ahead blaze upon you, making it difficult to see.  You stumble
    inside, until your hands hit upon a polished wooden rail.\r\nShading you eyes
    and squinting for good measure, you manage to see that the bridge is a multi-layered
    affair, with rows of tiered consoles below you extending down to the foot of
    the viewscreen. Where you stand is the highest tier, unoccupied except for a
    large comfortable chair, with a quaint old sailing ships wheel before it.\r\nYou
    give the wheel a spin, hoping against hope that it is more than ornamental. 
    The wheel spins easily, a testament to the loving care bestowed upon its ball-bearings
    in the form of regular greasing.  However, apart from testifying to the aforementioned
    loving care, the wheel is non-functional.\r\nGoing over to the captain\u2019s
    chair, you sit down, feeling yourself settle into the soft clasp of its silken
    cushions.  Your enjoyment of the chair does not prevent you from scorning the
    decadence of the former captain, and after a moment\u2019s indulgence, you get
    to the matter at hand.\r\n\u201CComputer,\u201D you say in your most commanding
    voice.  \u201CChange course!\u201D\r\n\u201CWho is squeaking?\u201D the computer
    asks politely.\r\n\u201CThe captain!  I am the captain now!\u201D you announce.\r\n\u201CYes,
    sir,\u201D the computer agrees without any resistance.  \u201CPlease input your
    command code.\u201D\r\n\u201CWa?  I don\u2019t have one,\u201D you reveal, your
    voice trembling with the kind of uncertainty that has spawned countless mutinies
    ever since men went to sea in groups together.\r\n\u201CNavigational command
    requires command status,\u201D the computer tells you sympathetically.\r\n\u201CI
    am the last crewmember left on board, am I not?\u201D you ask.\r\n\u201CYes,
    sir,\u201D the computer agrees.\r\n\u201CThat makes me the captain now, doesn\u2019t
    it?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes, captain.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo why don\u2019t I have command
    status?\u201D you want to know.\r\n\u201CYou need to submit your CMN and apply
    for command status.  If your application is successful, you will need to register
    and create a command code.  Then you can login and take command.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat\u2019s
    a CMN?\u201D you ask, perplexed.\r\n\u201CCrew Member Number,\u201D the computer
    informs you.  \u201CIt is the prominent number on your Crewmember Identification
    Card.\u201D\r\nNow you are getting somewhere!  You reach into your pocket for
    the card.  Not in that pocket.  You check the next likely pocket. Nothing.  You
    check the remainder of your pockets with growing dread and dismay that reaches
    a peak, then sends a wave of fear crashing down upon you, wiping you out and
    dumping you upon the shore of frustration.\r\nYou know you had it with you last
    night.  The card is used to make purchases from the funds in your on-board account. 
    You had it at the club last night, purchasing the alcohol that was subsequently
    poured down your throat, resulting in the state of extreme charm that you are
    still recovering from.  You must have lost it in the dance club.\r\n\u201CBe
    right back!\u201D you shout, springing up from the chair and dashing towards
    the exit.  The opulent corridor sweeps past as you run towards the lift, pound
    the button and hurl yourself into the small, vertically mobile room. You lift
    your extended finger to press the button, yet it pauses, trembling in anticipation
    of function.\r\nWhat floor was the dance club on?  There are 26 buttons, marked
    A to Z.  You are always getting lost on this damn ship.  You can\u2019t even
    remember the name of the dance club.\r\n\r\n1. If you know what floor you were
    on, \n2. Otherwise, you will just have to guess.\n"
