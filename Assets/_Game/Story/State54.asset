  storyText: "Leaving the observation lounge and the parent-bot, you hurry down the
    corridor.  You are sweating profusely, but the sweat evaporates off your skin
    in moments.  Although the ship is yet to pass into the corona of the sun, the
    heat is intense enough to start cooking you inside the ship like a loaf of bread
    in a baking tin.\r\nAs you hurry along, you glance at the air conditioning vents. 
    Can\u2019t someone turn on the cooling?  You see a computer panel ahead, and
    dash up to it.\r\n\u201CComputer!\u201D you gasp.  \u201CTurn on the cooling!\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease
    input command code,\u201D the computer asks politely.\r\n\r\n1. If you have a
    command code,\r\n2. Otherwise,\r\n"
