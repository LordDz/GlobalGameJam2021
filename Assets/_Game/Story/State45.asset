  storyText: "Looking at the soldier sympathetically, you say: \u201CIt\u2019s ok. 
    You don\u2019t have to pretend with me.\u201D\r\n\u201CHuh?\u201D the soldier
    says, a little taken aback.  Then he remembers that he is the one holding the
    blaster that is thrust into your chest.  \u201CLess talk, more ID!\u201D\r\nYou
    shake your head sadly.  \u201CI don\u2019t want to embarrass you in front of
    your friends about\u2026well, you know.  You should be very proud of what you\u2019ve
    achieved already.\u201D\r\n\u201CWhat are you babbling about?\u201D the soldier
    demands.\r\n\u201CYou know,\u201D you lower your voice to a whisper.  \u201CAbout
    not being able to read.\u201D\r\n\u201CI can read, space-brain!\u201D the soldier
    insists.  \u201CWhat do you think I am?\u201D\r\n\u201CAren\u2019t you a shaved
    gorilla?\u201D\r\nThe soldier grabs you around the neck.  \u201CYou having a
    go at me?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot at all!\u201D you wheeze.  \u201CI admire greatly
    what you\u2019ve been able to accomplish since leaving the jungle!\u201D\r\nSensing
    a homicidal inclination developing in the soldier, you desperately try to think
    of more witty things to say before it\u2019s too late.\r\nBefore you can speak,
    or get shot, one of the soldiers holding your arm speaks.  \u201CDon\u2019t kill
    him.  He could be the one where\u2019re after.  He matches the physical description.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo
    have 1000s of others!\u201D the soldier holding your neck spits; an unfortunate
    form of expression since he is wearing a visor over his face.  \u201CThe queen
    wouldn\u2019t waste an algorithm on a waste-of-space like this!\u201D\r\nThe
    soldiers discus the matter for a while, while you concentrate on breathing between
    the soldier\u2019s fingers.  Eventually they decide to take you back for \u2018inspection\u2019.
    The soldier holding your neck claims he can take \u2018the pipsqueak\u2019 back
    unaided, so the others unhand you and continue on their way.\r\nThe soldier releases
    you with a shove, and then raises his blaster.  \u201CRun, and I\u2019ll shoot
    you down like a dog!\u201D\r\nYou briefly consider pointing out that far more
    human beings are shot annually than dogs.  And rather than being the norm, most
    dogs are well-treated, as cruel treatment, including shootings, are illegal under
    every jurisdiction in the known universe apart from the planet Purros, which
    is populated by an intelligent feline race that is famous for yarn production
    and barbarous public dog torturing.\r\nInstead, you just rub your neck and continue
    on your way.  You are directed into the lift and the soldier presses the button
    for level X, the main engineering deck.  As the lift descends, the soldier removes
    his helmet to clean off the spittle from inside the visor.  He gives you a glare
    that warns you not to try anything.\r\n\r\n1. To try something\r\n2. To remain
    passive\n"
