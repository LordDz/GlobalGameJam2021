  storyText: "As you run along past the numbered cabins, you suddenly see cabin 24. 
    Reaching into your pocket, you take out the ID card and slap the electronic lock
    with it.  It beeps open, friendly green lights replacing the hostile red.  The
    door slides open and you dive inside, sealing the door behind you.\r\nYou walk
    far enough into Gary Fishbone\u2019s cabin to collapse in a chair and rest, hearing
    booted feet clomp rapidly by outside.  Safe for the moment, you look around the
    room.  The first thing you notice is that it is larger than your own cabin, and
    quite well furnished.  It has an ensuite, and a kitchenette, and a proper bed
    instead of a fold-down bunk.  What does Gary do that makes him so special?  On
    the small table in the centre of the cabin you see an electronic book.  Picking
    up the rectangular sheet of black glass, you tap the icon glowing in the centre
    and a title page lights up the face of the sheet.  The book is a programming
    manual.\r\nIf you ever get out of here, you decide to take up programming.  Searching
    the rest of the quarters for useful items you find a 25-metre coil of wire, a
    pair of pliers, a pair of size 5 gloves, a cleaver, a medical kit (5 wound closure
    pads, 3 salves, 3 stimulant shots; use only as directed), an 800 ml water bottle,
    and a bag of 20 2mm screws.  You only have enough pockets to carry three of these
    items.  If you choose to take the programming manual,  If you use the cleaver
    in battle, you may inflict 3 points of damage per hit.\r\nOnce you are ready,
    you cautiously open the cabin door.  Sticking your neck out into the corridor,
    you look left, look right, then look left again; and then proceed, left, along
    the corridor.\r\n\r\n1. to look at manual\n2. to continue\r\n"
