  storyText: "You throw yourself to the floor, the rocket tearing the air above you. 
    Searing hot air washes over you, burning your exposed skin (lose 10 STAMINA). 
    The rocket flies into the corridor you have just exited from and explodes far
    enough away for you to escape further injury.\r\nHearing the clang of the dog\u2019s
    paws on the deck, you ignore the pain and leap to you feet. You dash back into
    the smoky corridor, running as fast as you can.\r\n\u201CRop!\u201D you hear
    the dog-bot call after you.  \u201CRu rar ru re ra-rimirated.\u201D\r\nNot dissuaded
    from your flight by this statement, you pound the deck with your feet and throw
    yourself around another corner as another rocket blasts towards you.  You flee
    unharmed through a shower of wall-pieces.  You hear the dog\u2019s paws clicking
    the deck after you as you run through the corridors taking turns at random trying
    to lose the explosively expressive pup.  \r\nYou run until exhausted and rest
    inside a doorway.  You hear a distant whine (canine, not mechanical), but see
    no further sign of the dog-bot.  You carefully make your way to the nearest lift
    bay.  Only when you are inside do you feel safe.\r\nIf you have a medical kit,
    you can apply salves to your burns now.  Each salve will take 1 minute to apply,
    and will restore 4 points of STAMINA.  When you are ready, you press the button
    to go up to the command deck.\r\n\r\n1. to continue\r\n"
