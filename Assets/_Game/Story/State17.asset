  storyText: "The corridors on Deck A are so much more luxurious than you are accustomed
    to.  Thick, soft carpet lies underfoot, and your way is lit by old-fashioned
    brass and crystal wall lights.  Even the electronic touch screens are housed
    in ornate, gilt frames, displaying standby images of oil painting landscapes.\r\nAlthough
    you pause to brush off and straighten your coveralls; the opulent surrounds do
    not deter you from your mission, and you hurry towards the bridge.  Following
    the main corridor leads you past polished wooden doors, often set with gleaming
    brass plaques.  \r\nAs you pass on set of doors, you skid to a stop, hearing
    a pair of shrill, arguing voices within.  You glance at the plaque, which reads:
    \u2018Observation Dome.\u2019\r\n\r\n1. If you want to enter the dome and see
    who is arguing and about what\r\n2. If you would rather get on with saving your
    life\r\n"
