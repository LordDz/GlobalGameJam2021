  storyText: "Not without difficulty, you reach into your pocket and manage to insert
    your own ID into the slot in the chair arm.  You confirm that you are yourself
    and create your command code.\r\n\u201CThank you.  You may now log in and take
    command.\u201D\r\n\u201CFinally!\u201D you say. \u201CNow release me from this
    chair!\u201D\r\nThe restraints disappear and you spring from the chair in relief. 
    You stand on the bridge and put your hands on the steering wheel, the wooden
    handles feeling reassuring in your grasp.\r\n\u201CComputer, turn us around!\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease
    input command code.\u201D\r\n\u201C26.\u201D\r\n\u201CAccess granted.  Welcome,
    captain.  What are your instructions?\u201D\r\n\u201CTurn the ship around!  Reverse
    engines!  Get us out of danger!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, Navigational Command
    is currently unavailable.  Please try again later.\u201D\r\n\u201CWa?  There
    won\u2019t be a later!  What\u2019s wrong?\u201D\r\n\u201CA foreign entity has
    diverted control of all major systems to Engineering.\u201D\r\n\u201CAll major
    systems?\u201D you exclaim.  \u201CThen you can\u2019t do anything?\u201D\r\n\u201CNot
    so.  I notice the viewscreen is uncomfortably bright.  Would you like me to dim
    it for you?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes!\u201D you say.  Immediately the burning image
    on the viewscreen dulls, allowing you too look upon the source of your impending
    doom comfortably.  You feel no surge of pleasure at the power in your hands. 
    \u201CGive me a list of all the systems I have control over.\u201D\r\n\u201CLighting
    control, environmental control, public address system, end of list.\u201D\r\nFuming
    at all the time you have wasted, you storm out of the bridge.  You run along
    the corridor towards the lift.  The only thing to do now is to go to Engineering
    yourself.\r\nStalking into the lift, the button with the X on it suffers the
    sharp expression of your irritation as you pound in your selection.  The lift
    makes no complaint and descends to the Engineering deck.\r\nWith a tone the doors
    open and you step out into a corridor full of black-clad soldiers.  You retreat
    back into the lift and frantically tap the close door button, then the other
    buttons to get the lift to close its doors and start moving.\r\n\u201COi!\u201D
    shouts one of the Space Pirates; by which he means \u2018remain where you are
    so that you can be apprehended.\u2019  You keep raking the buttons as the doors
    start to close; your way of saying: \u2018I am disinclined to do as you demand
    and would rather depart with all haste!\u2019\r\nThe doors close, but not before
    one of the soldiers slips through.  He whips out a blaster as he looms over you,
    and in a fit of bravery, you grab hold of the blaster.  The two of you commence
    to grapple.\r\n\r\nIf either you or the soldier roll a double number to win the
    round, then the winner has managed to push the blaster towards the other and
    fire it, resulting in instant victory for that party.\r\n\n1. If you reduce the
    Pirate\u2019s STAMINA to 2 first\n2. If he reduces your STAMINA to 2 first\r\n"
