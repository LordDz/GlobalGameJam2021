  storyText: 'You move up the corridor away from the security station, and soon come
    upon an unobtrusive doorway that leads to a service corridor.  The service corridors
    allow types such as yourself to move about and access systems without having
    to offend the high-class passengers with your impecunious presence.  Thumping
    the panel, you enter the narrow corridor and close the door behind you.  The
    service corridor runs at right angles and takes you to a small room that is an
    intersection of four service corridors.

    In one corner is a ladder between
    hatches in the ceiling and floor.  The access tubes between decks will allow
    you to climb safely between decks rather than risking the lifts.
