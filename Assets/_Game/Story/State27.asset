  storyText: "You try to look meek and defeated, and the soldier takes his eyes off
    you for a moment.  You lunge at him.  His reflexes are sharp and he snatches
    up the stun-gun from his belt.  But you grab it as well, and grapple with him,
    kicking and punching while keeping the stun-gun pointing away from you.\r\n\r\nIf
    either you or the soldier roll a double number to win the round, then the winner
    has managed to push the stun-gun towards the other and fire it, resulting in
    instant victory for that party.\r\n\r\nSPACE PIRATE            SKILL 9      STAMINA
    12\r\n\r\n1. If you reduce the pirate\u2019s STAMINA to 2 first\r\n2. If he reduces
    your STAMINA to 2 first\n"
