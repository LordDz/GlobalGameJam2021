    your queen like?\u201D\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll know soon enough!\u201D the soldier
    grins unpleasantly.\r\nHis tone does not fill you with confidence, but you try
    to put a positive spin on things.  Maybe the queen is beautiful and single, embarking
    on the conquest of the universe because she is lonely.  You imagine yourself
    dragged before her in chains, and winning her heart somehow.  You then rule the
    universe at her side, your calming influence stopping this nonsense about slaughtering
    whole populations and laying waste to planets.\r\nBeing captured could actually
    be a step in the right direction for your career.  The lift reaches deck X and
    you are taken to an observation lounge and flung inside.  The doors close.  Not
    immediately seeing any haughty queens, beautiful or otherwise, in the lounge,
    you try the doors at each end, finding them locked.  \r\nYou have no option other
    than to wait\r\n1. to continue"
