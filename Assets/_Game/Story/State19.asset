  storyText: 'You open the locker and peer inside.  You find several power units
    (3v, 9v and 12v), 10-metre rolls of cable, lubricating grease in 50 and 100 ml
    tubes, and a few torches.  You may take any of these items, but only have enough
    pockets for 3 of them.

    Once you are ready, you close the locker.
