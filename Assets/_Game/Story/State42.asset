  storyText: "\u201CDeactivate!\u201D you shout.\r\nImmediately, lights on the parent-bot\u2019s
    head go dim and it sags, blaster arrays drooping harmlessly.  You march over
    and give the robot a kick.  It feels good, so you kick it again.  Glancing out
    the large window at the hot and hungry sun, you decide not to indulge yourself
    any further.\r\nLooking at the unit, you wonder if you should damage it more
    permanently while you have the chance.  Someone could come along and reactivate
    it, meaning it will come after you again.  The parent-bot is protected by tantrum-proof
    panelling, so you will not get far by bashing it.  There is an access panel to
    its sensitive insides, but it is sealed by screws.\r\n\r\n1. If you have any
    item(s) you think may be useful here\n2. otherwise.\n"
