  storyText: "You insert the ID of Gary Fishbone and try to create a command access
    account.  There is a buzzing warning tone and metal straps suddenly emerge from
    the chair and embrace you tighter than an over-affectionate auntie.\r\n\u201CRegistration
    denied!\u201D the computer says in a disapproving tone.  \u201CIdentity fraud
    is a serious crime!\u201D\r\n\u201CLet me go!\u201D you demand, struggling against
    the restraints.\r\n\u201CYou will remain confined until an officer arrives to
    take you into custody.\u201D\r\n\u201CThere are no officers!\u201D you remind
    the computer.\r\n\u201CThat is correct,\u201D it agrees, not seeming to see any
    problem with the situation.\r\n\u201CSo your plan is for me to stay here until
    we crash into the sun?\u201D\r\n\u201CI have no plans.  Yet the eventuality you
    describe seems inevitable.\u201D\r\n\u201CYou are being stupid and illogical!\u201D
    you say, trying to work free of the restraints.  But they are well designed and
    you slump in defeat.\r\n\u201CWe will both be destroyed, but all regulations
    will have been followed without error or ambiguity.\u201D  It sounds very pleased
    with itself.\r\n\u201CLook here,\u201D you say, trying to reason with the machine
    \u201CI am the only crewmember left, correct?\u201D\r\n\u201CYes.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo
    it is my responsibility to undertake the responsibilities of all the absent crew,
    correct?\u201D\r\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D\r\n\u201CSo, that means that the officer
    we are waiting for is, in fact, me!  I will take myself into custody.\u201D\r\n\u201CThat
    seems reasonable,\u201D the computer agrees.\r\n\u201CSo release me so I can
    escort myself out of here!\u201D\r\n\u201CAs you wish.  Please confirm your command
    status.\u201D\r\n\u201CWa?  How?\u201D\r\n\u201CPlease input your command code.\u201D\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t have one!\u201D\r\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, without command status, I
    cannot confirm your position as an officer and release you into your custody.\u201D\r\nYou
    swear at the computer with every bad word you know, releasing some of your tension
    and making the computer add a charge of indecent language in a public place.\r\n\r\n1.
    If you have your own ID card\n2. Otherwise\n"
