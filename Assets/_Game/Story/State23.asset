  storyText: "Leaving the dance club, you move off down the corridor towards the
    lift.  As you rush along, you hear booted feet ahead and feel a surge of relief. 
    You are not alone after all!  Maybe they can help you take control of the ship.\r\nYou
    hurry around the bend towards your newfound friends; but when they come into
    sight you begin to doubt the extent of the amiability.  There are four soldiers,
    clad in space-black fatigues with shiny black body armour and helmets with tinted
    visors. Each one carries a blaster rifle in hand, belts heavy with other weapons
    around their hips. Each one has an insignia of a planet with a large red P on
    it.  Inwardly you groan.  You have heard of these soldiers.  In recent times
    a mysterious tyrant has been taking over planets one by one, leaving dead husks
    in its wake.  There is much speculation about what P stands for, but most newscasters
    have seized upon the unimaginative \u2018Pirates.\u2019\r\nSeeing you, one calls
    out \u201CHalt!\u201D as they rush to apprehend you.  Two of them grab you and
    another thrusts his gun into your chest.  The other just chills nearby.  You
    imagine the soldier in front giving you a steely cold stare, but can see nothing
    through the visor.\r\n\u201CWho are you?\u201D the soldier before you demands
    to know.\r\n\r\n1. If you have your ID and want to show it to him\n2. If you
    have Gary Fishbone\u2019s ID and want to show it to him\n3. Otherwise, your only
    choice is to insult him\n"
