  storyText: 'The air burns your skin and eyes, sears your insides as you breath. 
    You squeeze your eyes shut.  The heat grows unbearable, and you start to cook. 
    Stumbling about, you look for a way to escape the heat. The walls begin to burn
    your hands when you touch them, then the polymer begins to melt.

    The heat
    is too much and you pass out several minutes before the ship turns into a molten
    glob and plunges into the sun.

    

    YOUR ADVENTURE ENDS HERE
