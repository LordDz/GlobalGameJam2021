  storyText: "Going over to the corner of the room, you pull the lever and open the
    hatch.  Lights automatically come on within, illuminating a narrow tube with
    rungs extending from the sides.  You climb in and reach the hatch at the bottom,
    kicking the lever to open the hatch.  You descend into an identical room below.\r\nNot
    pausing, you open the next hatch and descend all the way down to deck X.  You
    are exhausted by the time you arrive, but do not rest, feeling that time is running
    out.  \r\nYou hurry through the maze of service corridors, and then out into
    the main passages.  You find the Engineering Control Room, but hear voices inside. 
    Footsteps suddenly approach, and you slip through a nearby doorway into an observation
    lounge.  Even before you reach over to the control panel to close the doors,
    they slide shut and lock.\r\nYou hit the panel in surprise, but it remains a
    baleful red.  You have been trapped!  You hurry over to the door at the other
    end, but it is locked as well.  You thump the walls in frustration, but having
    no other choice settle yourself to wait.\r\n\r\n1. to continue\r\n"
