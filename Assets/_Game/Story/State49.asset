  storyText: "You press the button and the doors close.  You fidget impatiently as
    the lift seems to crawl along, the lights indicating the current deck seeming
    to linger teasingly.  Finally with a pleasant chime the doors open and you spring
    out.  You pound the floor with your feet as you run at world-record-breaking
    pace despite the lack of time-keeping officials.  Yes, this all looks familiar\u2026 
    but the further you go the more uncertain you become.  No this is all wrong. 
    You are on the wrong deck!  You spin about and go back the way you came.  Reaching
    the lift, you jump inside\u2026\r\n\r\n1. To try another level\r\n"
