  storyText: 'You take the right corridor, and soon come upon an unobtrusive doorway
    that leads to a service corridor.  The service corridors allow types such as
    yourself to move about and access systems without having to offend the high-class
    passengers with your impecunious presence.  Thumping the panel, you enter the
    narrow corridor and close the door behind you.  The service corridor runs at
    right angles and takes you to a small room that is an intersection of four service
    corridors.

    In one corner is a ladder between hatches in the ceiling and
    floor.  The access tubes between decks will allow you to climb safely between
    decks rather than risking the lifts.  There is also a supply locker here, and
    you consider taking the time to search for something useful.

    

    1.
    To take the time to search the locker

    2. To move on quickly
