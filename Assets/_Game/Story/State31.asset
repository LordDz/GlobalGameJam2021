  storyText: "Hurrying down the hallway you follow the emergency lights through the
    wide bare halls.  Nearing the launching bay, you hear ahead the whir of mechanical
    legs.  Rounding a corner you step into the evacuation bay, a large semicircular
    lounge with doorways in the curved wall leading to corridors and ultimately the
    escape pods.\r\nAll the doors are closed and red lights inform you that the pods
    have all been launched. There is a robotic dog here, creating the whirring as
    it patrols back and forth.  It is a strange-looking thing, with a greyhound-shaped
    body and limbs of black polymer, and an oversized, head that looks like a rocket-launcher
    with an array of sensors on top.\r\nIn the seconds it has taken you to take in
    the scene, the dog-bot has been walking away from you, but it is about to turn
    back and will see you.\r\n\r\n1. If you want to leave before the dog-bot sees
    you\n2. If you want to go out and ask the doggy-woggy what\u2019s happening\n"
