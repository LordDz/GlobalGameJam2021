  storyText: 'You hurry over to the nearest lift and press the up button.  The doors
    open promptly and you step inside, stabbing at the button for level A.

    The
    lift whines and shoots upwards, sending your stomach falling around your ankles. 
    It is an unpleasant sensation, especially after a night of being really charming. 
    You stagger from the lift on level A and promptly vomit onto the deck (lose 1
    STAMINA).  You pause for a minute, considering whether or not to find one of
    the medical bays that are on every level.  You will be able to sober yourself
    up, maybe get some medical supplies in case you are hurt or you find an injured
    someone.

    

    1. To look for the medical bay

    2. To press on to the
    bridge
